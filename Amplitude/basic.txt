5. Basic
    - how to get data
        - import existing data
        - track data (using Amplitude SDKs and APIs
    - client-side vs server-side
        - Client-side: Choose client-side sources for the simplest initial instrumentation.
        - Server-side: Choose server-side sources if you want track server-side events and leverage existing user data tracking workflows.
        - Hybrid: Choose a hybrid approach that includes both client-side and server-side sources to get the benefits of simpler implementation and ability to track server-side events.
        - Third party: Choose these sources if you already have a third-party data layer such as ad networks or marketing automation tools.

7. kotlin spring server side
    - Java SDK 제공되지 않기 떄문에 HTTP API 를 통해 직접 서버 사이드 이벤트 전송한다.
